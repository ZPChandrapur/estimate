/*
  # Create subwork_design_photos table

  1. New Tables
    - `subwork_design_photos`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key)
      - `subwork_id` (text, references subworks.subworks_id)
      - `photo_url` (text, photo URL from storage)
      - `photo_name` (text, original filename)
      - `file_size` (bigint, file size in bytes)
      - `created_by` (uuid, references auth.users)
      - `created_at` (timestamp)

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on `subwork_design_photos` table
    - Add policies for users to manage their own photos
    - Add policies for admins to manage all photos

  3. Indexes
    - Index on subwork_id for efficient queries
    - Index on created_by for user-specific queries
